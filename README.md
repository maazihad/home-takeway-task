# URL Shortening System

This is a simple URL shortening system built using React, where users can enter a long URL and generate a short URL. The short URLs will be stored in the browser's localStorage. The system also allows users to view the list of short URLs and open the long URL associated with each short URL in a new tab.

## Features

- Entry Page: Allows users to enter a long URL and generate a short URL.

- List Page: Displays a list of all short URLs that have been created. Clicking on a short URL opens the associated long URL in a new tab.

## Technologies Used

- React: The frontend of the application is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

- React Router: Used for handling routing between different pages of the application.

- Ant Design (AntD): A React UI framework used for styling the application components.

- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework used to style the components and provide a responsive layout.
